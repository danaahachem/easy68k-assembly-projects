# Easy68K Assembly Projects

This repository contains a collection of Motorola 68000 assembly programs developed using the [Easy68K](http://www.easy68k.com/) simulator.

It includes both **a group project** and several **individual codes** I wrote as practice or coursework. Most files contain multiple code snippets, with all **non-running parts commented out**, so you only need to focus on the active one when running in Easy68K.

## üìÅ Contents

### üë• Group Project
- **Group1Submission.X68**  
  Final submission for a collaborative university project using Motorola 68K assembly.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Personal Projects
Each of the following files includes multiple standalone examples or exercises. Only the target code is left uncommented for simulation.

| File Name        | Description                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `2Matrices.X68`  | Operations involving two matrices (e.g. addition, multiplication). |
| `arrays.X68`     | Basic array manipulation and processing.         |
| `EXAM14.X68`     | Solved assembly problems similar to past exam questions. |
| `EXAM17.X68`     | More exam-style problems and logic tasks.        |
| `LARGEST.X68`    | Finds the largest number among a set.            |
| `linkedlists.X68`| Simulates linked list behavior using memory blocks. |

## üõ† How to Run

1. Open **Easy68K** and load the `.X68` file.
2. The file contains **multiple codes**, but only **one will be uncommented and ready to run**.
3. To switch between codes, **comment out the current code and uncomment another**.
4. Press **F3** to Assemble and **F5** to Simulate.
